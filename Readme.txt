4. In the hashtag list, mention the tags, the bot will search for that tag on instagram and follow the people who follow that tag. The tag will be selected randomly, this way there is high probablity that those people will follow you back. Then it will close the browser.

5. Bot will sleep randomly for 1000 to 1500 sec and execute the unfollow script. In the unfollow script, specify the limit of following people. If the following people are less than limit, bot will close browser. If they exceed the limit, bot will scroll all the way down to your following list, and unfollow the old people who you followed. Bot will remove from bottom to top and when the limit is reached, the .

6. Then randomly after 30 min to 1 hour the bot will login and repeat all the process again.
